Currently the database has to be manually initialized in the Neo4j Desktop.



Steps:
Connect signup form to server
  Send signup info to database
  If user already exists alert client
  else create a new user and alert client
Once alerted, client
  On already exists, throws alert
  On created, proceeds to login with credentials

Connect login form to server
  Send login info to database
  If authenticated grab user's games and send to client
  Otherwise alert client of failure

On Client side,
  set state to loggedin
    thereby removing login/signup form
