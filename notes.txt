Currently the database has to be manually initialized in the Neo4j Desktop.



Steps:
//////////   AUTH   /////////////
Connect signup form to server - x
  Send signup info to database - x
  If user already exists alert client - x
  else create a new user and alert client - x

Once alerted, client
  On already exists, throws alert
  On created, proceeds to login with credentials

Connect login form to server
  Send login info to database
  If authenticated grab user's games and send to client
  (Once suggestions work, also change suggestions)
  Otherwise alert client of failure

On Client side,
  set state to loggedin
    thereby removing login/signup form



//////////  ADD GAMES TO USER  //////////





///////// SETUP INITIAL PAGE GAMES  ////////
Refactor client to show suggestions right off the bat
  Have default suggestions for unlogged in
  Change suggestions based on user upon login
